**The project methodology involves the following steps:**

**Data collection:** A dataset of satellite images with water bodies was collected from various sources, including online image repositories and open-source datasets.

**Data preprocessing:** The collected dataset was preprocessed, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation, to enhance the model's ability to identify water bodies in different environmental conditions.

**Data annotation:** The images were annotated by segmenting the water bodies from the background using pixel-wise labeling, which creates a mask for each image.

**Model selection:** The project uses two models - a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a U-Net model, both widely used for image segmentation tasks. The CNN model is used as a baseline, while the U-Net model is used for comparison.

**Model training:** The models were trained on the annotated dataset using a combination of loss functions, such as Dice loss and binary cross-entropy loss, to optimize the models' segmentation accuracy.

**Model evaluation:** The models were evaluated on a test set of images using metrics such as pixel accuracy, mean intersection over union (mIoU), and F1 score to determine their performance.

Overall, the Water-bodies image segmentation project using CNN and U-Net model aims to automate the identification and segmentation of water bodies from satellite images using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. The project's success can be beneficial in various applications, such as climate change monitoring, water management, and environmental protection.
